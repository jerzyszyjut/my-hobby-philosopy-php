## HTML website with meme gallery implemented with PHP

Extended https://github.com/jerzyszyjut/my-hobby-philosopy-js with meme gallery implemented in PHP

This is a project I did during my first term of informatics studies on Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology.

The PHP part is written in MVC architecure. It uses MongoDB database. To manage outside dependencies I used php composer. 

Website allows basic user logic (creating account, loggin in, logging out), handling adding photos to gallery (creating thumbnails, adding watermark), visibility settings on photos.
